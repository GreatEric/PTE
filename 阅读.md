### Tokyo Skytree

Team Lab's digital mural at the entrance to Tokyo’s Skytree, one of the world’s monster skyscrapers, is 40 metres long and immensely detailed. But 
however massive this form of digital art becomes — and it's a form subject to rampant inflation — Inoko's theories about seeing are based on more modest and often pre-digital sources. An early devotee of comic books and cartoons (no surprises there), then computer games, he recognised when he started to look at traditional Japanese art that all those forms had something in common :something about the way they captured space. In his discipline of physics, Inoko had been taught that photographic lenses , along with the conventions of western art, were the logical way of transforming three dimensions into two, conveying the real world onto a flat surface . But Japanese traditions employed 'a different spatial logic', as he said in an interview last year with j-collabo.org, that is 'uniquely Japanese'.

Team Lab 在东京晴空塔入口处的数字壁画，这是世界上巨大的摩天大楼之一，长 40 米，非常详细。但无论这种形式的数字艺术变得多么庞大——而且它是一种受到猖獗通货膨胀影响的形式——猪子关于观看的理论是基于更谦虚且通常是前数字来源的。他是漫画书和卡通片的早期爱好者（这并不奇怪），然后是电脑游戏，当他开始研究日本传统艺术时，他意识到所有这些形式都有一些共同点：它们捕捉空间的方式。在他的物理学学科中，猪子被教导说，摄影镜头以及西方艺术的惯例是将三个维度转换为二维的合乎逻辑的方式，将现实世界传送到平面上。但日本传统采用了“不同的空间逻辑”，正如他去年在接受 j-collabo.org 采访时所说，这是“独特的日本”。

### Ebb and Flow

Roman poet Ovid wrote that “there is nothing constant in the universe. All ebb and flow, and every shape that’s born bears in its womb the seeds of change”. These words are remarkably relevant when one considers the way life has changed through time as revealed by fossil record.

罗马诗人奥维德写道：“宇宙中没有什么是不变的。所有的潮起潮落，每一个诞生的形状都孕育着变化的种子”。当人们考虑化石记录所揭示的生命随时间变化的方式时，这些词非常相关。

### Dictionary Publishers

For the first time, dictionary publishers are incorporating real, spoken English into their data. It gives lexicographers (people who write dictionaries) access to a more vibrant, up-to-date  vernacular language which has never really been studied before.

词典出版商第一次将真实的口语英语纳入他们的数据中。它使词典编纂者（编写词典的人）能够接触到一种以前从未真正研究过的更有活力、最新的白话语言

### Health Concept

The concept of health holds different meanings for different people and groups. These meanings of health have also changed over time. This difference is no more evident than in Western society today, when notions of health and health promotion are being challenged and expanded in new ways.

健康的概念对不同的人和群体具有不同的含义。这些健康的含义也随着时间而改变。这种差异在当今的西方社会中最为明显，当时健康和健康促进的概念正以新的方式受到挑战和扩展。

### Heart of Study

Turning now to the heart of the study, in two divisions an attempt was made to change the supervision so that the decision levels were pushed down and detailed supervision of the workers reduced. More general supervision of the clerks and their supervisors was introduced. In addition, the managers, assistant managers, supervisors and assistant supervisors of these two divisions were trained in group methods of leadership, which they endeavored to use as much as their skill would permit during the experimental year. For easy reference, the experimental changes in these two divisions will be labelled the ‘participative program’!

现在转向研究的核心，在两个部门尝试改变监督，以降低决策层级并减少对工人的详细监督。对文员及其主管进行了更全面的监督。此外，这两个部门的经理、助理经理、主管和助理主管都接受了小组领导方法的培训，他们在实验年度尽可能多地使用这些方法。为了便于参考，这两个部门的实验性变化将被标记为“参与计划”！

### Birds

Some birds of prey have learned to control fire, a skill previously thought to be unique to humans. The birds appear to deliberately spread wildfires in order to  flush out prey. The finding suggests that birds may have beaten us to the use of fire.

一些猛禽已经学会了控制火力，这种技能以前被认为是人类独有的。这些鸟似乎故意散布野火以冲走猎物。这一发现表明，鸟类可能在使用火方面打败了我们。

### A National Crisis

In 1868, botanist Jules-émile Planchon unmasked the culprit behind a national crisis. For five years, a blight had been stealing across France’s vineyards. Its cause was invisible, its spread inexorable. Always it followed the same pattern. First a single vine would  wither ,then a circle of plants. Entire vineyards were wiped out within years.

1868 年，植物学家 Jules-émile Planchon 揭露了一场国家危机背后的罪魁祸首。五年来，一种枯萎病一直在法国的葡萄园中蔓延。它的原因是无形的，它的蔓延是不可阻挡的。它始终遵循相同的模式。先是一根藤蔓枯萎，然后是一圈植物。几年之内，整个葡萄园都被夷为平地。

### Nissan

Nissan will overhaul the inspection process for its Japan-destined vehicles for the first time in decades as the carmaker seeks to address a widening inspection scandal that has forced it to suspend production for the domestic market. The company said on Thursday that unauthorized workers had been certifying vehicles set for sale in the Japanese market, even after the company announced the recall of nearly 1.2m cars earlier this month over the same issue. With investors increasingly concerned about Japan Inc’s adherence to standards — concerns that were most recently inflamed by the Kobe Steel data falsification scandal — the news pushed Nissan shares down 1.6 per cent on Friday, and also weighed on the prices of its suppliers. HirotoSaikawa, Nissan’s chief executive, pledged “drastic measures” to deal with the problem, namely the suspension of vehicle production for the home market at all six factories in Japan run by the company and its affiliate, Nissan Shatai.

日产汽车将数十年来首次对其运往日本的车辆的检查程序进行全面检查，因为该汽车制造商试图解决日益扩大的检查丑闻，该丑闻已迫使其暂停国内市场的生产。该公司周四表示，未经授权的工人一直在对在日本市场销售的车辆进行认证，即使该公司本月早些时候宣布因同一问题召回近 120 万辆汽车。随着投资者越来越担心日本公司遵守标准——最近因神户制钢数据造假丑闻而引发的担忧——这一消息推动日产股价周五下跌 1.6%，并打压其供应商的价格。日产汽车首席执行官 HirotoSaikawa 承诺采取“严厉措施”来解决这一问题，即该公司及其关联公司日产沙泰在日本运营的所有六家工厂都暂停了面向国内市场的汽车生产。

### Academic Writing

Academic writing is an expression of logic that is the product of thinking. This means that the writing that you produce is a reflection of your intellectual abilities. It puts into words your knowledge and your conceptual understanding and shows evidence of your ability to think critically.

学术写作是一种逻辑的表达，是思维的产物。这意味着你写的文章是你智力的反映。它将您的知识和概念理解用文字表达出来，并显示您批判性思考能力的证据。

### Left-handed Population

In any given population, about ten percent of the people are left-handed and this figure remains relatively stable over time. So-called “handedness” runs in families, but what causes it and why the proportion of left-handed to right-handed people is a constant are still a mystery. One thing we do know is that hand dominance is related to brain asymmetry; and it seems to be generally agreed that the human brain is profoundly asymmetric, and that understanding how this works will tell us much about who we are and how our brains work. Brain (function) is distributed into the left and right hemispheres, and this is crucial for understanding language, thought, memory, and perhaps even creativity. For right-handed people, language activity is mainly on the left side. Many left-handers also have left-side language dominance, but a significant number may have language either more evenly distributed in both hemispheres or else predominantly on the right side of the brain. Because left-handedness is seen as a key to the complex anatomy of the brain, scientists are searching for links to other conditions, including immune disorders, learning disabilities, and reduced life expectancy.

在任何给定的人口中，大约 10% 的人是左撇子，而且随着时间的推移，这个数字保持相对稳定。所谓的“惯用手”在家庭中普遍存在，但其原因以及为什么左撇子与右撇子的比例是一个常数仍然是一个谜。我们知道的一件事是，手的优势与大脑不对称有关。人们似乎普遍认为，人脑是极度不对称的，理解它的工作原理将告诉我们很多关于我们是谁以及我们的大脑如何工作的信息。大脑（功能）分布在左右半球，这对于理解语言、思想、记忆甚至创造力至关重要。对于惯用右手的人来说，语言活动主要在左侧。许多左撇子也有左侧语言优势，但很大一部分人的语言可能更均匀地分布在两个半球，或者主要位于大脑的右侧。由于左撇子被视为大脑复杂解剖结构的关键，科学家们正在寻找与其他疾病的联系，包括免疫紊乱、学习障碍和预期寿命缩短。

### Computer Viruses

Computer viruses have been a fact of life at least since the 1980s, if not before. They can cause companies to lose hours of working time and they can also spread panic among computer users everywhere. There are, however, several distinct types of computer infection – all loosely referred to as viruses – and they each work in a slightly different way. A particularly nasty one is the worm, which is a program designed to sneak its way into an entire computer network, and reproduce itself over and over again. Then there is the Trojan, which strictly speaking isn’t a virus, but a piece of software that appears to do one thing, but actually does something malicious instead. When the 'unsuspecting' operator introduces it into the computer, the alien program will take over the machine. With Trojans you have to be particularly careful because they can often be introduced by way of a message advertising an anti-virus product. So what motivates someone to introduce a virus into the computer systems of innocent victims? Perhaps it’s simply the desire to prove that it can be done. Or because it gives the kind of pleasure you get from solving a difficult problem – nowadays people protect their computers with all sorts of security software, so it takes considerable skill to break through all the defences and introduce a virus.

至少从 1980 年代（如果不是更早的话）起，计算机病毒就已经成为现实。它们可能导致公司失去数小时的工作时间，还可能在世界各地的计算机用户中传播恐慌。然而，有几种不同类型的计算机感染——统称为病毒——它们各自的工作方式略有不同。一个特别令人讨厌的是蠕虫，它是一种旨在潜入整个计算机网络并一遍又一遍地自我复制的程序。然后是木马，严格来说它不是病毒，而是一种看似做某事，但实际上却做了恶意的软件。当“毫无戒心”的操作员将其引入计算机时，外星程序将接管机器。对于特洛伊木马，您必须特别小心，因为它们通常可以通过宣传反病毒产品的消息的方式引入。那么，是什么促使有人将病毒引入无辜受害者的计算机系统中呢？也许这只是想证明它可以做到的愿望。或者因为它给了你解决难题的那种乐趣——现在人们用各种安全软件保护他们的电脑，所以要突破所有的防御并引入病毒需要相当高的技能。

### Light Energy

Light is usually described as a form of energy and it is indeed a kind of electromagnetic energy, not much different from radio waves, television signals, heat, and X-rays. All of these are made up of waves that spread , bend, interfere with one another, and react with obstacles in their path, rather like waves in water. A physicist might tell you that light, along with all its electromagnetic relatives, is really a form of matter, little different from more substantial matter such as houses and, like them, it is made up of individual particles. Light particles, called photons, travel in streams, similar to the way in which water pours through a hose. To most people, this might sound paradoxical or illogical, as many things to do with physics seem to these days. How can light be both energy and matter, wave and particle? The reason it can be is, in fact, not at all complicated : all energy is a form of matter. Almost everybody recognizes — even if they do not understand — Einstein’s famous equation, E =mc2, which spells it out: E refers to energy and m to the mass of matter. Furthermore, all matter has some of the characteristics of waves and some of the particles, but the waves of such solid-seeming things as houses are not discernible and can generally be ignored because ordinary matter acts as if it were made up of particles.

光通常被描述为一种能量形式，它确实是一种电磁能，与无线电波、电视信号、热量和 X 射线没有太大区别。所有这些都是由传播、弯曲、相互干扰并与路径上的障碍物发生反应的波浪组成的，就像水中的波浪一样。物理学家可能会告诉你，光，连同它所有的电磁亲戚，实际上是一种物质形式，与房屋等更实质的物质几乎没有区别，并且像它们一样，它是由单个粒子组成的。称为光子的光粒子在溪流中传播，类似于水通过软管倒出的方式。对大多数人来说，这可能听起来自相矛盾或不合逻辑，就像当今许多与物理学有关的事情一样。光怎么可能既是能量又是物质，既是波又是粒子？事实上，它的原因并不复杂：所有的能量都是物质的一种形式。几乎每个人都知道——即使他们不理解——爱因斯坦著名的方程 E = mc2，它说明了它：E 指的是能量，m 指的是物质的质量。再者，所有的物质都有一些波的特性，也有一些粒子的特性，但是像房子这样看似固体的东西的波是不可识别的，一般可以忽略，因为普通物质的行为就好像它是由粒子组成的一样。

### Heart Functions

The heart functions as a pump at the centre of the circulatory system. In humans it is located in the chest cavity, between the lungs, a bit to the left. The heart consists of four chambers surrounded by a very strong muscular wall, the myocardium. The upper chambers, the right and left atria,receive blood entering the heart, and the lower chambers, the right and left ventricles pump the blood out of the heart, via the pulmonary and the systemic circulatory systems. The two systems work as follows. Blood from the body enters the right atrium, is passed into the right ventricle and from there is propelled through the pulmonary artery to the lungs. In the lungs the blood releases carbon dioxide and absorbs oxygen and is then transported back to the heart into the left atrium. From here it passes into the left ventricle, which pumps the oxygenated blood around the body.

心脏在循环系统的中心起到泵的作用。在人类中，它位于胸腔内，两肺之间，偏左一点。心脏由四个被非常坚固的肌肉壁——心肌包围的腔室组成。右心房和左心房的上腔室接收进入心脏的血液，而右心室和左心室的下腔室通过肺和全身循环系统将血液泵出心脏。这两个系统的工作方式如下。来自身体的血液进入右心房，进入右心室，然后从那里通过肺动脉被推进到肺部。在肺部，血液释放二氧化碳并吸收氧气，然后被输送回心脏进入左心房。它从这里进入左心室，左心室将含氧血液泵送到全身。

### Scientific Method

The logic of the scientific method was set out by John Stuart Mill in 1843 and was named the method of difference. A simple example of what he meant by this is to take two glasses of water which are identical in every respect. Introduce a few drops of ink into one of these glasses. The water changes color! According to Mill’s method of difference it is safe to assume that the change in the color of the water is due to the introduction of a new factor — the independent variable — in this case, the ink.
科学方法的逻辑由约翰·斯图亚特·密尔于 1843 年提出，并被命名为差异法。他的意思的一个简单例子是喝两杯在各方面都相同的水。在其中一个玻璃杯中滴入几滴墨水。水变颜色了！根据 Mill 的差分法，可以安全地假设水颜色的变化是由于引入了一个新因素——自变量——在这种情况下是墨水。

### European Culture

Many people today think of culture in the way that it was thought of in Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries. This concept of culture reflected inequalities within European societies and their colonies around the world. This understanding of culture equates culture with civilization and contrasts both with nature or non-civilization. According to this understanding of culture, some countries are more civilized than others, and some people are more cultured than others. Anything that doesn’t fit into this category is labeled as chaos or anarchy. From this perspective, culture is closely tied to cultivation, which is the progressive refinement of human behavior. In practice, culture referred to elite goods and activities such as haute cuisine, high fashion or haute couture, museum-caliber art and classical music. The word cultured referred to people who knew about and took part in these activities. For example, someone who used culture in this sense might argue that classical music is more refined than music by working-class people, such as jazz or the indigenous music traditions of aboriginal peoples .

今天，许多人以 18 世纪和 19 世纪初欧洲对文化的看法来看待文化。这种文化概念反映了欧洲社会及其在世界各地的殖民地内部的不平等。这种对文化的理解将文化等同于文明，并与自然或非文明形成对比。按照这种对文化的理解，有的国家比别人文明，有的人比别人文明。任何不属于这一类的东西都被标记为混乱或无政府状态。从这个角度看，文化与修养息息相关，修养是人类行为的逐步细化。在实践中，文化指的是高级美食、高级时装或高级时装、博物馆级艺术和古典音乐等精英商品和活动。文化一词是指知道并参与这些活动的人。例如，在这种意义上使用文化的人可能会争辩说，古典音乐比工人阶级的音乐更精致，例如爵士乐或土著人民的土著音乐传统。

### Sand Battery

Finnish researchers have installed the world's first fully working "sand battery", which can store green power for months at a time. The developers say this could solve the problem of year-round supply, a major issue for green energy. Using low-grade sand, the device is charged up with heat made from cheap electricity from solar or wind. The sand stores the heat at around 500C, which can then warm homes in winter when energy is more expensive. Because of climate change and now thanks to the rapidly rising price of fossil fuels, there's a surge of investment in new renewable energy production. But while new solar panels and wind turbines can be quickly added to national grids, these extra sources also present huge challenges. Right now, most batteries are made with lithium and are expensive with a large, physical footprint, and can only cope with a limited amount of excess power. One of the big challenges now is whether the technology can be scaled up to really make a difference — and will the developers be able to use it to get electricity out as well as heat? The efficiency falls dramatically when the sand is used to just return power to the electricity grid.

芬兰研究人员安装了世界上第一个完全工作的“沙电池”，一次可以储存数月的绿色电力。开发商表示，这可以解决全年供应问题，这是绿色能源的一个主要问题。该设备使用低品位的沙子，用来自太阳能或风能的廉价电力产生的热量充电。沙子将热量储存在 500 摄氏度左右，这样可以在冬季能源更昂贵时为房屋供暖。由于气候变化，现在由于化石燃料价格迅速上涨，对新的可再生能源生产的投资激增。但是，虽然新的太阳能电池板和风力涡轮机可以快速加入国家电网，但这些额外的资源也带来了巨大的挑战。目前，大多数电池都是用锂制成的，而且价格昂贵，占用空间大，而且只能处理有限的多余电量。现在最大的挑战之一是该技术是否可以扩大规模以真正发挥作用——开发人员能否使用它来发电和供热？当沙子仅用于将电力返回到电网时，效率会急剧下降。

### Security Footage

The introduction of security footage in courtrooms as evidence is increasingly common. With the number of closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras rising, the likelihood of images deemed relevant for criminal proceedings being recorded also increases. However, while CCTV footage may arguably have assisted in achieving convictions in some high-profile cases, can it assist in the overall reduction of violence against women? A well-known example in Australia of CCTV helping solve a crime is the footage pulled from a shop on Sydney Road the night Jill Meagher was raped and murdered by Adrian Bayley. This footage was mentioned in his sentencing in 2013. In the same year, Simon Gittany was found guilty of the murder of his partner Lisa Harnum. CCTV footage – taken from his own security cameras – was again interpreted as key evidence. Beyond the courtroom, news media reports of crime are saturated with the use of CCTV footage. In both contexts, it is often seen to be decisive – an authoritative and objective witness that can tell us “what really happened”. While used in a range of offenses, its inclusion in instances of extreme (and public) violence against women can mean certain images receive significant and sustained media attention, and may remain online indefinitely. The strength of CCTV in our public consciousness is such that questions of privacy are often dismissed as inconsequential. CCTV installed in the homes of family violence victims has even been considered.

在法庭上引入安全录像作为证据越来越普遍。随着闭路电视 (CCTV) 摄像机数量的增加，被认为与刑事诉讼相关的图像被记录的可能性也在增加。然而，虽然闭路电视录像可以说有助于在一些备受瞩目的案件中定罪，但它能否有助于整体减少对妇女的暴力行为？澳大利亚一个著名的闭路电视帮助破案的例子是吉尔·米格被阿德里安·贝利强奸和谋杀的当晚，从悉尼路的一家商店中提取的镜头。这段视频在他 2013 年的判决中被提及。同年，西蒙·吉塔尼被判犯有谋杀其伴侣丽莎·哈纳姆的罪行。闭路电视录像——取自他自己的安全摄像机——再次被解释为关键证据。在法庭之外，新闻媒体对犯罪的报道充斥着闭路电视录像的使用。在这两种情况下，它通常被认为是决定性的——一个权威和客观的证人，可以告诉我们“到底发生了什么”。虽然用于一系列罪行，但将其包含在针对女性的极端（和公共）暴力事件中可能意味着某些图像会受到媒体的持续关注，并可能无限期地保持在线状态。闭路电视在我们公众意识中的力量如此之大，以至于隐私问题经常被认为无关紧要而被忽视。甚至考虑在家庭暴力受害者家中安装闭路电视。

### Flowers and Bees

Most people assume, correctly, that flowers look the way they do to attract insects that pollinate them. But that’s not the whole story. Scientists have now discovered that plants have another ‘trick up their leaves’ to make themselves irresistible to even the most choosy insect. Cambridge University’s Beverley Glover and her colleagues recently set up some fake flowers filled with a sugar solution, which they kept at different temperatures. Unleashing a team of bumblebees on their floral offerings, they watched as the insects visited the flowers to drink the surrogate nectar. Very quickly, it became obvious that the bees were concentrating on the flowers with the warmest nectar. Just in case it was something to do with the color of the fake flowers, the scientists also tried a different color combination and got the same result.

大多数人正确地认为，花朵看起来是为了吸引为它们授粉的昆虫。但这还不是全部。科学家们现在发现，植物还有另一种“欺骗叶子”的能力，即使是最挑剔的昆虫也无法抗拒。剑桥大学的 Beverley Glover 和她的同事们最近设置了一些装满糖溶液的假花，他们将它们保存在不同的温度下。他们放出一队大黄蜂献花，看着这些昆虫来到花朵上喝替代花蜜。很快，很明显蜜蜂正集​​中在花蜜最温暖的花朵上。万一这与假花的颜色有关，科学家们还尝试了不同的颜色组合，得到了相同的结果。

### Giant Exoplanets

Giant exoplanets, like the so-called 'hot Jupiters' that are similar in characteristics to the solar system's biggest planet and orbit very close to their host stars, are excellent targets for astronomers in their search for their extrasolar worlds. The size and proximity of these planets is easy to detect as they create a large decrease in brightness when passing in front of their parent stars .

巨大的系外行星，如所谓的“热木星”，其特征与太阳系最大的行星相似，轨道非常靠近它们的主恒星，是天文学家寻找太阳系外世界的绝佳目标。这些行星的大小和距离很容易发现，因为它们在经过其母星前方时会导致亮度大幅下降。

### Selfies

To better understand selfies and how people form their identities online, the researchers combed through 2.5 million selfie posts on Instagram to determine what kinds of identity statements people make by taking and sharing the photos. Nearly 52 percent of all selfies fell into the appearance category: pictures of people showing off their make-up, clothes, lips, etc. Pics about looks were two times more popular than the other 14 categories combined. After appearances, social selfies with friends, loved ones, and pets were the most common (14 percent). Then came ethnicity pics (13 percent), travel (7 percent), and health and fitness (5 percent). The researchers noted that the prevalence of ethnicity selfies (selfies about a person’s ethnicity, nationality or country of origin) is an indication that people are proud of their backgrounds. They also found that most selfies are solo pictures, rather than taken with a group. Overall, an overwhelming 57 percent of selfies on Instagram were posted by the 18-35-year-old crowd, something the researchers say isn't too surprising considering the demographics of the social media platform. The under-18 age group posted about 30 percent of selfies.

为了更好地了解自拍以及人们如何在网上形成自己的身份，研究人员梳理了 Instagram 上的 250 万张自拍帖子，以确定人们通过拍摄和分享照片做出什么样的身份声明。近 52% 的自拍属于外貌类别：人们炫耀自己的妆容、衣服、嘴唇等的照片。关于外貌的照片的受欢迎程度是其他 14 个类别总和的两倍。在露面之后，与朋友、亲人和宠物的社交自拍是最常见的（14%）。然后是种族照片（13%）、旅行（7%）和健康与健身（5%）。研究人员指出，种族自拍（关于一个人的种族、国籍或原籍国的自拍）的流行表明人们为自己的背景感到自豪。他们还发现，大多数自拍都是单人照片，而不是与一群人合影。总体而言，Instagram 上 57% 的自拍是由 18-35 岁的人群发布的，研究人员表示，考虑到社交媒体平台的人口统计数据，这并不令人惊讶。 18 岁以下年龄段的人发布了大约 30% 的自拍。

### Shrimp Farm

Over the past two decades around a third of the world’s mangrove swamps have been converted for human use, with many turned into valuable shrimp farms. In 2007 an economic study of such shrimp farms in Thailand showed that the commercial profits per hectare were $9,632. If that were the only factor, conversion would seem an excellent idea. However, proper accounting shows that for each hectare government subsidies formed $8,412 of this figure and there were costs, too: $1,000 for pollution and $12,392 for losses to ecosystem services. These comprised damage to the supply of foods and medicines that people had taken from the forest, the loss of habitats for fish, and less buffering against storms. And because a given shrimp farm only stays productive for three or four years, there was the additional cost of restoring them afterwards: if you do so with mangroves themselves, add another $9,318 per hectare. The overall lesson is that what looks beneficial only does so because the profits are retained by the private sector, while the problems are spread out across society at large, appearing on no specific balance sheet.

在过去的二十年里，世界上大约三分之一的红树林沼泽被改造为人类使用，其中许多变成了有价值的养虾场。 2007 年对泰国此类养虾场的经济研究表明，每公顷的商业利润为 9,632 美元。如果这是唯一的因素，那么转换似乎是一个绝妙的主意。然而，适当的核算表明，每公顷政府补贴构成了这一数字的 8,412 美元，而且也有成本：污染为 1,000 美元，生态系统服务损失为 12,392 美元。这些包括对人们从森林中获取的食品和药品供应的破坏、鱼类栖息地的丧失以及对风暴的缓冲作用减少。而且因为一个特定的养虾场只能维持三到四年的生产，之后恢复它们需要额外的成本：如果你用红树林本身这样做，每公顷再增加 9,318 美元。总的教训是，看起来有益的东西只是因为利润被私营部门保留，而问题遍布整个社会，没有出现在具体的资产负债表上。

### Green spaces

Green spaces contribute significantly to a reduction in soil and aerial temperatures during spells of hot weather, so contributing to human wellbeing. In the garden context, there is, however, little information as to what extent various types of plants differ in their cooling potential and how certain planting combinations may maximize cooling under a scenario of low rainfall and minimal water inputs.

在炎热天气期间，绿色空间有助于降低土壤和空气温度，从而为人类福祉做出贡献。然而，在花园环境中，关于各种类型的植物在其冷却潜力方面的差异程度以及某些种植组合如何在低降雨量和最少水输入的情况下最大限度地冷却的信息很少。

### Product Selling

Once an organization has its product to sell, it must then determine the appropriate price to sell it at. The price is set by balancing many factors including supply-and-demand, cost, desired profit competition, perceived value, and market behavior. Ultimately, the final price is determined by what the market is willing to exchange for the product. Pricing theory can be quite complex because so many factors influence what the purchaser decides is a fair value. It also should be noted that, in addition to monetary exchange, price can be the exchange of goods or services as in a barter agreement, or an exchange of specific behavior, such as a vote in a political campaign.

一旦一个组织有它的产品要出售，它就必须确定适当的价格来出售它。价格是通过平衡许多因素来确定的，包括供需、成本、期望的利润竞争、感知价值和市场行为。最终，最终价格取决于市场愿意为产品交换的价格。定价理论可能非常复杂，因为有很多因素会影响购买者决定的公允价值。还应该注意的是，除了货币交换之外，价格可以是易货协议中的商品或服务交换，也可以是特定行为的交换，例如政治竞选中的投票。

### Estee Lauder

She transformed beauty into big business by cultivating classy sales methods and giving away samples. Leonard Lauder, chief executive of the company his mother founded, says she always thought she 'was growing a nice little business.' And that it is. A little business that controls 45% of the cosmetics market in U.S. department stores. A little business that sells in 118 countries and last year grew to be $3.6 billion big in sales. The Lauder family's shares are worth more than $6 billion. But early on, there wasn't a burgeoning business; there weren't houses in New York, Palm Beach, or the south of France. It is said that at one point there was one person to answer the telephones who changed her voice to become the shipping or billing department as needed. You more or less know the Estee Lauder story because it' s a chapter from the book of American business folklore. In short, Josephine Esther Mentzer, daughter of immigrants, lived above her father's hardware store in Corona, a section of Queens in New York City. She started her enterprise by selling skin creams concocted by her uncle, a chemist, in beauty shops, beach clubs and resorts. No doubt the potions were good - Estee Lauder was a quality fanatic - but the sales lady was better. Much better. And she simply outworked everyone else in the cosmetics industry. She stalked the bosses of New York City department stores until she got some counter space at Saks Fifth Avenue in 1948. And once in that space, she utilized a personal selling approach that proved as potent as the promise of her skin regimens and perfumes .

她通过培养优雅的销售方式和赠送样品，将美容变成了大生意。伦纳德·劳德是他母亲创立的公司的首席执行官，她说她一直认为自己“正在发展一家不错的小企业”。就是这样。一家控制着美国百货公司化妆品市场 45% 的小企业。一家在 118 个国家销售的小企业，去年的销售额增长到 36 亿美元。兰黛家族的股票价值超过 60 亿美元。但在早期，并没有蓬勃发展的业务。纽约、棕榈滩或法国南部没有房子。据说曾经有一个人接听电话，她根据需要改变了声音成为运输或计费部门。你或多或少知道雅诗兰黛的故事，因为它是美国商业民间传说书中的一章。简而言之，移民的女儿 Josephine Esther Mentzer 住在她父亲位于纽约市皇后区科罗纳的五金店楼上。她通过在美容店、海滩俱乐部和度假村销售由化学家叔叔调制的护肤霜开始了她的事业。毫无疑问，这些药水很好——雅诗兰黛是一个质量狂热者——但售货员更好。好多了。而且她只是在化妆品行业超过了其他所有人。她跟踪纽约市百货公司的老板，直到 1948 年在萨克斯第五大道获得了一些柜台空间。一旦进入那个空间，她就采用了一种个人销售方式，这种方式被证明与她的皮肤护理和香水的承诺一样有效。

### Plants and Animals

From the earliest civilisations, plants and animals have been portrayed as a means of understanding and recording the potential uses, such as their economic and healing properties. From the first illustrated catalogue of medicinal plants, De Materia Medica by Dioscorides, in the first century through to the late fourteenth century the illustration of plants and animals changed very little. Woodcuts in instructional manuals and herbals were often repeatedly copied over the centuries, resulting in a loss of definition and accuracy so that they became little more than stylized decoration. With the growing popularity of copperplate engravings, the traditional use of woodcuts declined and the representation of plants and animals became more accurate. Then, with the emergence of artists such as Albrecht Durer and Leonardo Da Vinci, naturalists such as Otto Brunfels, Leonhard Fuchs in botany and Conrad Gesner and Ulisse Aldrovandi in zoology, nature began to be depicted in a more realistic style. Individual living plants or animals were observed directly and their likeness rendered onto paper or vellum .

从最早的文明开始，植物和动物就被描绘成一种理解和记录潜在用途的手段，例如它们的经济和治疗特性。从第一世纪到 14 世纪后期的第一个药用植物插图目录 De Materia Medica，植物和动物的插图几乎没有变化。几个世纪以来，指导手册和草药中的木刻经常被反复复制，导致清晰度和准确性的丧失，因此它们只不过是程式化的装饰。随着铜版画的日益普及，木刻版画的传统使用减少了，植物和动物的表现变得更加准确。然后，随着阿尔布雷希特丢勒和达芬奇等艺术家的出现，植物学领域的奥托·布伦费尔斯、莱昂哈德·富克斯和动物学领域的康拉德·格斯纳和乌利塞·阿尔德罗万迪等自然主义者的出现，开始以更写实的风格描绘自然。直接观察个别活的植物或动物，并将它们的肖像画在纸或牛皮纸上。

### Naming Storms

The practice of giving storms personal names appears to have originated with Clement Wragge, an Australian meteorologist who in the 1890s entertained himself by naming storms after women, mythical figures , and politicians that he didn't like. The modern system of using personal names developed during World War II, when meteorologists began using women's names — often those of wives or girlfriends — instead of cumbersome designations based on latitude and longitude. Short and quickly understood, names were easier to transmit over the radio and easier to keep straight if there was more than one storm in a given area. The system was formalized in 1953 when the National Weather Service put together an alphabetical list of female names to be used for storms in the Atlantic basin. Male names were added to the list in 1979 when women's groups pointed out the sexism of using only female names.

给风暴起个人名字的做法似乎起源于澳大利亚气象学家克莱门特·瓦格 (Clement Wragge)，他在 1890 年代通过以他不喜欢的女性、神话人物和政治家的名字命名风暴来娱乐自己。现代使用人名的系统是在二战期间发展起来的，当时气象学家开始使用女性的名字——通常是妻子或女朋友的名字——而不是基于纬度和经度的繁琐名称。简短且易于理解的名称更容易通过无线电传输，并且如果给定区域内有不止一场风暴，则更容易保持直截了当。该系统于 1953 年正式成立，当时国家气象局整理了一份按字母顺序排列的女性姓名列表，用于大西洋盆地的风暴。 1979 年，当女性团体指出只使用女性名字的性别歧视时，男性名字被添加到列表中。

### Cognitive Health

Neuropsychological testing is one way to assess cognitive health. However, this option can be costly and labor intensive. In many cases, basic screening will suffice for an understanding of a given individual's cognitive health status. There are a number of excellent tools available to practitioners for basic screening and tracking of cognitive health. Many of these tools are designed for use with older people, but some are meant for use with younger people as well. The Alzheimer's Association website offers a cognitive assessment toolkit that includes the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit algorithm for the assessment of cognition. This assessment uses patient history, observations by clinicians, and concerns raised by the patient, family, or caregivers. The toolkit further includes three measures validated for use by professionals to assess and track a patient's cognitive health. These measures include the General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition, Memory Impairment Screen, and the Mini-Cog brief psychometric test.

神经心理学测试是评估认知健康的一种方法。然而，这种选择可能成本高昂且劳动强度大。在许多情况下，基本筛查足以了解特定个体的认知健康状况。从业者可以使用许多优秀的工具来进行认知健康的基本筛查和跟踪。这些工具中有许多是为老年人设计的，但也有一些是为年轻人设计的。阿尔茨海默氏症协会网站提供了一个认知评估工具包，其中包括用于评估认知的 Medicare 年度健康访问算法。该评估使用患者病史、临床医生的观察以及患者、家人或护理人员提出的问题。该工具包还包括三个经过验证的措施，供专业人员用于评估和跟踪患者的认知健康。这些措施包括认知全科医生评估、记忆障碍筛查和 Mini-Cog 简短心理测试。

### Chanan Tigay

Don't expect a straightforward answer from Chanan Tigay about the authenticity or even the existence of what was promoted as the earliest version of the fifth and final book of the Jewish Torah, known to Christians as the Book of Deuteronomy in the Old Testament. As an author who spent years trying to unravel a juicy mystery and get it down on paper, Tigay wants you to read his book, "The Lost Book of Moses: The Hunt for the World's Oldest Bible," to find the answer. But at a talk on Wednesday, the writer, journalist, and fellow offered listeners an enticing peek, describing how he landed on the story of the mysterious manuscript and about his years trying to track down the document. From the author's description, it was a wild, Indiana Jones-type ride that included a competition to find the relic, false starts, dead ends, trips to faraway places, and an ultimate breakthrough close to home.

不要指望 Chanan Tigay 直接回答关于被宣传为犹太律法书第五部也是最后一本书的最早版本的真实性，甚至存在，这本书被基督徒称为旧约中的申命记之书。作为一位花了数年时间试图解开一个多汁的谜团并将其写在纸上的作家，蒂盖希望您阅读他的书《摩西失落的书：寻找世界上最古老的圣经》以找到答案。但在周三的一次演讲中，这位作家、记者和同事向听众提供了一个诱人的视角，描述了他是如何了解这份神秘手稿的故事的，以及他多年来试图追查这份文件的经历。根据作者的描述，这是一次狂野的印第安纳琼斯式骑行，包括寻找遗物的比赛、错误的开始、死胡同、远行，以及离家近的终极突破。

### Internet Use

People are spending twice as much time online compared to 10 years ago, fueled by increasing use of tablets and smartphones. The biggest increase has been among young adults, with time spent online almost tripling from 10 hours and 24 minutes each week in 2005 to 27 hours and 36 minutes in 2014. In total, the average adult spends more than 20 hours online a week, which includes time spent on the internet at work. Meanwhile the average person spends 2.5 hours every week 'online while on the move' - away from their home, work or place of study. This is a five-fold increase from 2005, when the figure was just 30 minutes. Overall, the proportion of adults using the internet has risen by half - from six in ten in 2005 to almost nine in ten today, according to Ofcom's Media Use and Attitudes 2015 report, which questioned 1,890 adults aged 16 and over about their internet consumption habits.

与 10 年前相比，人们在网上花费的时间增加了一倍，这得益于平板电脑和智能手机的使用增加。增幅最大的是年轻人，上网时间几乎增加了两倍，从 2005 年的每周 10 小时 24 分钟增加到 2014 年的 27 小时 36 分钟。总的来说，成年人平均每周上网时间超过 20 小时，这包括工作中在互联网上花费的时间。与此同时，平均每个人每周“在移动中”上网的时间为 2.5 小时——远离他们的家、工作或学习场所。这比 2005 年增加了 5 倍，当时这个数字只有 30 分钟。根据 Ofcom 的 2015 年媒体使用和态度报告，该报告向 1,890 名 16 岁及以上的成年人询问了他们的互联网消费习惯。

### Civil War

A Civil War reenactment is in part a memorial service. It is partly, too, a leisure activity. Furthermore most reenactors assert an educational import to the performance, and to develop their roles many pursue archival research with a rare dedication. On the other hand Civil War reenactments are increasingly commercial spectacles, with as many as fifty thousand Americans routinely gathering at (or near) historical Civil War battlefields in order to stage performances that purport to recreate the conflict, while hundreds of thousands more spectate (Hadden 1996:5). I will show how theoretical issues of authenticity arise as practical problems in the Civil War reenactment community by presenting my own observations from the 2006 Gettysburg reenactment and by relying on a number of texts produced by participant-observers. In particular I will refer to Robert Lee Hodge, who was made famous by Tony Horwitz's 1996 book, Confederates in the Attic, and who served as a kind of Virgil to the author on his journey through a Confederate Valhalla. From these sources I will argue that 'Living History' performances require an interpretive apparatus that takes genuine history as its authority, while remaining external to both participants and tourists, who may well be unaware of how closely their own involvement approximates genuine historical events.

内战重演部分是追悼会。这在一定程度上也是一种休闲活动。此外，大多数重演者都声称对表演具有教育意义，并且为了发展他们的角色，许多人以罕见的奉献精神从事档案研究。另一方面，内战重演越来越成为商业奇观，多达五万美国人经常聚集在（或附近）历史悠久的内战战场，以进行旨在重现冲突的表演，而更多的观众（哈登1996:5)。我将通过介绍我自己对 2006 年葛底斯堡重演的观察并依靠参与者观察者产生的一些文本，来展示真实性的理论问题是如何在内战重演社区中作为实际问题出现的。我将特别提到罗伯特·李·霍奇（Robert Lee Hodge），他因托尼·霍维茨（Tony Horwitz）1996 年的著作《阁楼上的同盟者》而出名，在作者穿越同盟瓦尔哈拉的旅程中，他充当了作者的维吉尔。从这些资料来看，我认为“活的历史”表演需要一个以真实历史为权威的解释机构，同时对参与者和游客都保持外部，他们很可能不知道他们自己的参与与真实历史事件有多接近。

### Umami

Umami was first identified in Japan, in 1908, when Dr. Kikunae Ikeda concluded that Kombu, a type of edible seaweed, had a different taste than most foods. He conducted experiments that found that the high concentration of glutamate in Kombu was what made it so tasty. From there, he crystallized monosodium glutamate (MSG), the seasoning that would become popular the world over. Decades later Umami became scientifically defined as one of the five individual tastes sensed by receptors on the tongue. Then in 1996, a team of University of Miami researchers studying taste perception made another breakthrough. They discovered separate taste receptor cells in the tongue for detecting Umami. Before then, the concept was uncharted. 'Up until our research, the predominant wisdom in the scientific community was that Umami was not a separate sense. It was just a combination of the other four qualities (salty, sweet, bitter, sour)', explained Dr. Stephen Roper, the University of Miami physiology and biophysics professor who helped zero in on the taste along with Nirupa Chaudhari, the team‘s lead researcher.

鲜味最早是在1908年的日本发现的，当时池田菊苗(Kikunae Ikeda)博士得出结论，海带是一种可食用的海藻，与大多数食物的味道不同。他进行的实验发现，海带中高浓度的谷氨酸是它如此美味的原因。从那里，他结晶了味精(MSG)，这是一种后来风靡世界的调味品。几十年后，鲜味被科学地定义为舌头上的感受器能感知到的五种不同的味道之一。1996年，迈阿密大学的一组研究味觉的研究人员取得了另一项突破。他们在舌头上发现了用来检测鲜味的单独的味觉受体细胞。在那之前，这个概念是未知的。“在我们的研究之前，科学界的主流观点是鲜味不是一种独立的感觉。它只是其他四种味道(咸、甜、苦、酸)的结合，”迈阿密大学生理学和生物物理学教授斯蒂芬·罗珀博士解释道。他和该团队的首席研究员尼鲁帕·乔杜里一起帮助研究了这种味道。

### Desert Ants

There comes a time in a desert ant's life when a piece of food is too large to ignore, but too heavy to lift, and the only way to get it home is to adopt a new style of walking. The long-legged and speedy Cataglyphis fortis normally covers ground with a three-legged stride that moves two legs forwards on one side, and one on the other. For the next step, the insect mirrors the move with its other three legs. But recordings of ants in the Tunisian desert reveal that when faced with oversized lumps of food 10 times their own weight, the forward 'tripod' walking style is abandoned . Unable to lift the morsels in their mandibles, the ants drag the food backwards instead, moving all six legs independently. 'This is the first time we have seen this in any ants,' said lead author Sarah Pfeffer at the University of Ulm in Germany. The ants' long legs already help keep their bodies away from the scorching desert floor and enable them to speed around at up to 60 cm per second. The researchers, who publish the findings on ant locomotion and navigation in the Journal of Experimental Biology, believe that robotics will be one of the first technologies to benefit from the discovery.

在沙漠蚂蚁的一生中，总有那么一段时间，一块食物太大了，不能忽视，但又太重了，抬不起来，把它带回家的唯一方法就是采用一种新的走路方式。长腿和快速的fortis蜥通常用三条腿的步幅来覆盖地面，两条腿向前移动在一边，另一条向前移动在另一边。下一步，昆虫会用其他三条腿模仿这个动作。但对突尼斯沙漠中的蚂蚁的记录显示，当面对10倍于自身重量的超大食物块时，它们会放弃“三脚架”前进的行走方式。蚂蚁无法用下颌骨提起食物，只能用六条腿独立移动，把食物向后拖。德国乌尔姆大学(University of Ulm)的主要作者萨拉·普费弗(Sarah Pfeffer)说:“这是我们第一次在蚂蚁身上看到这种现象。”蚂蚁的长腿已经帮助它们的身体远离灼热的沙漠地面，并使它们能够以每秒60厘米的速度移动。研究人员在《实验生物学杂志》(Journal of Experimental Biology)上发表了关于蚂蚁移动和导航的研究结果，他们认为机器人技术将是第一批从这一发现中受益的技术之一。

### Good Looks in Votes

It is tempting to try to prove that good looks win votes, and many academics have tried. The difficulty is that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and you cannot behold a politician’s face without a veil of extraneous prejudice getting in the way. Does George Bush possess a disarming grin, or a facetious smirk? It’s hard to find anyone who can look at the president without assessing him politically as well as physically.

试图证明美貌能赢得选票是很诱人的，许多学者也尝试过。困难之处在于，情人眼里出西施，你不可能不受外界偏见的干扰而看清一个政客的脸。乔治·布什的笑容是让人放松的，还是滑稽的傻笑?很难找到一个人在看到总统的时候，不会对他进行政治和身体上的评估。

### Mini Helicopter

A mini helicopter modelled on flying tree seeds could soon be flying overhead. Evan Ulrich and colleagues at the University of Maryland in College Park turned to the biological world for inspiration to build a scaled-down helicopter that could mimic the properties of full-size aircraft. The complex design of full-size helicopters gets less efficient when shrunk, meaning that standard mini helicopters expend most of their power simply fighting to stay stable in the air. The researchers realized that a simpler aircraft designed to stay stable passively would use much less power and reduce manufacturing costs to boot. It turns out that nature had beaten them to it. The seeds of trees such as the maple have a single-blade structure that allows them to fly far away and drift safely to the ground. These seeds, known as samaras, need no engine to spin through the air, thanks to a process called autorotation. By analyzing the behavior of the samara with high-speed cameras, Ulrich and his team were able to copy its design.

一架以会飞的树种子为模型的迷你直升机可能很快就会从头顶飞过。马里兰大学帕克分校的埃文·乌尔里希(Evan Ulrich)和他的同事们从生物界寻找灵感，建造了一架可以模仿全尺寸飞机性能的缩小版直升机。全尺寸直升机的复杂设计在缩小后效率会降低，这意味着标准迷你直升机的大部分动力都用来保持在空中的稳定。研究人员意识到，一种设计得更简单的被动保持稳定的飞机将消耗更少的动力，并降低启动的制造成本。事实证明，是大自然抢先了他们一步。像枫树这样的树的种子有一个单叶结构，这使它们可以飞得很远，并安全地飘落到地面上。这些被称为萨马拉斯的种子不需要发动机就能在空气中旋转，这要归功于一种被称为自动旋转的过程。通过用高速摄像机分析翅果的行为，乌尔里希和他的团队能够复制它的设计。

Underground Houses

Underground houses have many advantages over conventional housing. Unlike conventional homes, they can be built on steep surfaces and can maximize space in small areas by going below the surface. In addition, the materials excavated in construction can be used in the building process. Underground houses have less surface area so fewer building materials are used, and maintenance costs are lower. They are also wind, fire, and earthquake resistant, providing a secure and safe environment in extreme weather. One of the greatest benefits of underground living is energy efficiency. The earth's subsurface temperature remains stable, so underground dwellings benefit from geothermal mass and heat exchange, staying cool in the summer and warm in the winter. This saves around 80% in energy costs. By incorporating solar design this energy bill can be reduced to zero, providing hot water and heat to the home all year round.

与传统房屋相比，地下房屋有许多优点。与传统住宅不同的是，它们可以建在陡峭的表面上，通过地下建筑，可以使小面积的空间最大化。此外，在施工中挖掘的材料可以在建筑过程中使用。地下房屋的表面积更小，因此使用的建筑材料更少，维护成本也更低。它们还具有抗风、防火和抗震性能，在极端天气中提供安全的环境。住在地下的最大好处之一是能源效率。地球的地下温度保持稳定，因此地下住宅受益于地热质量和热交换，夏天凉爽，冬天温暖。这样可以节省大约80%的能源成本。通过采用太阳能设计，能源账单可以减少到零，全年为家庭提供热水和热量。

### Intelligence Comparison

Comparing the intelligence of animals of different species is difficult, how do you compare a dolphin and a horse? Psychologists have a technique for looking at intelligence that does not require the cooperation of the animal involved. The relative size of an individual's brain is a reasonable indication of intelligence. Comparing across species is not as simple as generally expected. An elephant will have a larger brain than a human has simply because it is a large beast. Instead, we use the Cephalization index, which compares the size of an animal's brain with the size of its body. Based on the Cephalization index, the brightest animals on the planet are humans, followed by great apes, porpoises and elephants. As a general rule , animals that hunt for a living (like canines) are smarter than strict vegetarians (you don't need much intelligence to outsmart a leaf of lettuce). Animals that live in social groups are always smarter and have larger EQ's than solitary animals.

比较不同种类动物的智力是困难的，你怎么比较海豚和马呢?心理学家有一种观察智力的技术，不需要动物的合作。一个人大脑的相对大小是智力的合理指标。跨物种比较并不像一般想象的那么简单。大象的大脑会比人类的大，因为它是一种大型动物。相反，我们使用头化指数，它将动物大脑的大小与身体的大小进行比较。根据脑化指数，地球上最聪明的动物是人类，其次是类人猿、海豚和大象。一般来说，以捕食为生的动物(如犬科动物)比严格的素食主义者聪明(你不需要太多的智力就能比一片生菜聪明)。群居动物总是比独居动物更聪明，情商也更高。

### Asking Questions

It is important that scientists be seen as normal people asking and answering important questions. Good, sound science depends on hypotheses, experiments and reasoned methodologies. It requires a willingness to ask new questions and try new approaches. It requires one to take risks and experience failures. But good science also requires contextual understanding, clear explanation and concise presentation. Our country needs more scientists who are willing to step out in the public arena and offer their opinions on important matters. We need more scientists who can explain what they are doing in language that is compelling and understandable to the public. Those of us who are not scientists should also be prepared to support public engagement by scientists, and to incorporate scientific knowledge into our public communications.

重要的是，科学家应该被视为提出和回答重要问题的普通人。好的、可靠的科学依赖于假设、实验和合理的方法。它要求你愿意提出新问题，尝试新方法。它需要一个人去冒险和经历失败。但好的科学也需要对背景的理解、清晰的解释和简明的表述。我们的国家需要更多的科学家，他们愿意走到公共舞台上，对重要问题发表自己的意见。我们需要更多的科学家，他们能够用公众信服和理解的语言解释他们正在做的事情。我们当中那些不是科学家的人也应该准备好支持科学家的公共参与，并将科学知识纳入我们的公共传播。

### Emotional Intelligence

High emotional intelligence can help a manager improve workplace communication skills, employee motivation and organizational effectiveness. If a manager has high empathy , a key component of emotional intelligence, he or she will be able to listen to the concerns of employees and will be more understanding of their needs, wants and concerns. This will most likely translate into increased motivation and satisfaction of employees and ultimately will have a positive effect on the effectiveness of the business.

高情商可以帮助管理者提高职场沟通技巧、员工积极性和组织效率。如果一个经理有高度的同理心(情商的一个关键组成部分)，他或她将能够倾听员工的担忧，并将更加理解他们的需求、愿望和担忧。这将极有可能转化为增加员工的积极性和满意度，并最终对业务的有效性产生积极的影响。

### Road Taken

The poem “The Road Not Taken” by Robert Frost is about the choices that one makes in life. It tells about a man who comes to a fork in the road he is traveling upon. He feels sorry that he cannot travel both paths as he must choose one. Frost uses this divergence in the road to represent a point in the man’s life where he has to choose the direction he wishes to take in life.

罗伯特·弗罗斯特的诗《未选之路》是关于一个人在生活中所做的选择。它讲述的是一个人走到一个岔路口的故事。他感到遗憾，他不能走两条路，因为他必须选择一条。弗罗斯特用这条道路上的分歧来代表这个人生命中的一个点，在这个点上他必须选择他想要的生活方向。

### Animals’ Role

Animals have played a major role in human’s lives throughout history. Today, scientific research is trying to discover the positive aspects of living with companion animals. Animals have been used as an alternative form of treatment for many years. More recently it has been discovered that owning a pet can help lower people’s blood pressure, enhance the chances of living after a heart attack, keep people more active and provide more satisfaction with life. It is theorized that this happens because pets help people become more social, provide a means to give and receive affection , and help connect us with the natural world.

纵观历史，动物在人类生活中扮演着重要的角色。如今，科学研究正试图发现与伴侣动物生活在一起的积极方面。多年来，动物一直被用作替代治疗方式。最近，人们发现，养宠物可以帮助降低人们的血压，提高心脏病发作后的生存机会，让人们更加活跃，并对生活提供更多的满足感。有理论认为，这是因为宠物帮助人们变得更加社交，提供了一种给予和接受情感的方式，并帮助我们与自然世界联系起来。

### Hans Christian Andersen

Fans of biographical criticism have a luxurious source in the works of Hans Christian Andersen. Like Lewis Carroll (and, to a lesser extent, Kenneth Grahame), Andersen was near-pathologically uncomfortable in the company of adults. Of course, all three had to work and interact with adults, but all three really related well to children and their simpler worlds. Andersen, for a time, ran a puppet theater and was incredibly popular with children, and, of course, he wrote an impressive body of fairy tales which have been produced in thousands of editions since the 19th century.

传记批评的粉丝在汉斯·克里斯蒂安·安徒生的作品中有丰富的素材。和刘易斯·卡罗尔(以及肯尼斯·格拉汉姆(Kenneth Grahame)一样，安徒生和成年人在一起时几乎病态地不自在。当然，这三款游戏都必须与成年人一起工作和互动，但这三款游戏都非常适合儿童和他们的简单世界。安徒生曾经经营过一个木偶剧院，非常受孩子们的欢迎。当然，他还写了大量令人印象深刻的童话故事，自19世纪以来，这些童话故事被印制了数千种版本。

### Propensity about Risk

An individual’s propensity to take risk is influenced by their own experience and that of others. The key feature in risk-taking is balancing of perceptions of the risk and the possible rewards, and this balance may be a reflection of an individual’s particular type of personality.

一个人的冒险倾向受自己和他人经历的影响。冒险的关键特征是平衡对风险和可能的回报的看法，而这种平衡可能是一个人的特定类型的个性的反映。

### AI

After years in the wilderness, the term ‘artificial intelligence’ (AI) seems poised to make a comeback. AI was big in the 1980s but vanished in the 1990s. It re-entered public consciousness with the release of Al, a movie about a robot boy. This has ignited public debate about AI, but the term is also being used once more within the computer industry. Researchers, executives and marketing people are now using the expression without irony or inverted commas. And it is not always hype. The term is being applied, with some justification, to products that depend on technology that was originally developed by AI researchers. Admittedly, the rehabilitation of the term has a long way to go, and some firms still prefer to avoid using it. But the fact that others are starting to use it again suggests that AI has moved on from being seen as an over-ambitious and under-achieving field of research.

在沉寂多年之后，“人工智能”(AI)一词似乎即将卷土重来。人工智能在20世纪80年代很流行，但在90年代消失了。随着一部关于机器人男孩的电影《机器人总动员》的上映，它重新进入了公众的视野。这引发了公众对AI的辩论，但这个词也在计算机行业中再次被使用。研究人员、高管和市场营销人员现在使用这个表达时不带讽刺意味，也不带倒逗号。而且这并不总是炒作。这个术语正被用在依赖人工智能研究人员最初开发的技术的产品上，这是有一定道理的。不可否认，这个词的复兴还有很长的路要走，一些公司仍然倾向于避免使用它。但其他人开始再次使用它的事实表明，人工智能已经不再被视为一个野心过大、成就不足的研究领域。

### Entrepreneur Philosophy

The majority of the British officials in the 1840s adopted the entrepreneur philosophy, which supported a policy of non-intervention in the Irish plight. Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel was different. He showed compassion toward the Irish by making a move to repeal the Corn Laws, which had been put in place to protect British grain producers from the competition of foreign markets. For this hasty decision, Peel quickly lost the support of the British people and was forced to resign . The new Prime Minister, Lord John Russell, allowed assistant Charles Trevelyan to take complete control over all of the relief efforts in Ireland. Trevelyan believed that the Irish situation should be left to Providence. Claiming that it would be dangerous to let the Irish become dependent on other countries, he even took steps to close food consumers that were selling corn and to redirect shipments of corn that were already on their way to Ireland. A few relief programs were eventually implemented, such as soup kitchens and workhouses; however, these were poorly.

19世纪40年代，大多数英国官员采用了企业家哲学，支持对爱尔兰困境不进行干预的政策。英国首相罗伯特·皮尔爵士则不同。为了表达对爱尔兰人的同情，他废除了《玉米法》，该法案旨在保护英国谷物生产商免受外国市场的竞争。由于这个草率的决定，皮尔很快就失去了英国人民的支持，被迫辞职。新首相约翰·罗素勋爵(Lord John Russell)允许助理查尔斯·特里维廉(Charles Trevelyan)全权负责爱尔兰的所有救援工作。特里维廉认为爱尔兰的情况应该由上帝来决定。他声称，让爱尔兰人依赖其他国家是危险的，甚至采取措施关闭出售玉米的食品消费者，并改变已经在运往爱尔兰的玉米的运输路线。一些救济项目最终得到了实施，比如施粥所和济贫院;然而，这些都很糟糕。

### Food Minding

At supper Johnson talked of good eating with uncommon satisfaction ."Some people," said he, "have a foolish way of not minding, or pretending not to mind, what they eat. For my part, I mind my belly very studiously , and very carefully; for I look upon it, that he who does not mind his belly will hardly mind anything else," He was, for the moment, not only serious but vehement . " Yet I have heard him, upon other occasions, talk with great contempt of people who were anxious to gratify their palates; and the 206th number of his Rambler is a masterly essay against gulosity . His practice, indeed, I must acknowledge, may be considered as casting the balance of his different opinions upon this subject; for I never knew any man who relished good eating more than he did.

吃晚饭时，约翰逊津津有味地谈起美食。“有些人，”他说，“有一种愚蠢的做法，就是不介意，或者假装不介意他们吃什么。就我而言，我非常细心地照顾我的肚子;因为我认为，一个不介意自己肚子的人几乎不会介意其他任何事情。”他此刻不仅严肃而且激烈。然而，在其他场合，我曾听到他以极其轻蔑的口气谈论那些急于满足自己食欲的人;他的《漫步者》第206期是一篇反对贪吃的杰作。事实上，我必须承认，他的做法可以被认为是在平衡他在这个问题上的不同意见;因为我从来没有见过谁比他更喜欢美味的食物。

### Power Mix

Imagine a time in the not too distant future when your power comes from a seamless mix of renewable energy and traditional sources. It is delivered by a grid that manages thousands of windmills and hundreds of thousands of customers. Computer controlled, the grid is able to manage instant variations in supply and demand and provides a real time power balance. Far more complex than anything in existence today, it is called a smart grid. This technology is a new frontier in power supply and seen as a green solution to current outdated management systems. When introduced smart grids will result in energy savings and will allow consumers a choice in their electricity charges and to be able to select the cheapest time slots. The difficulty for the energy industry is that smart grids do not exist in reality and the power companies cannot experiment with existing supplies. Without an actual grid to conduct research on Professor Wu has had to design a simulated laboratory including input from theoretical wind generators and solar panels to feed into a constantly operating system. For an authentic approach researchers built various types of equipment failures into the grid to test the system. And it works.

想象一下，在不久的将来，你的能源来自可再生能源和传统能源的无缝结合。它是由一个管理着数千座风车和数十万客户的电网提供的。计算机控制的电网能够管理供需的即时变化，并提供实时的电力平衡。它被称为“智能电网”，远比目前存在的任何电网都要复杂。该技术是电力供应领域的新前沿，被视为对当前过时管理系统的绿色解决方案。一旦引入智能电网，将节省能源，并将允许消费者选择电费，并能够选择最便宜的时段。能源行业的困难在于智能电网在现实中并不存在，电力公司无法对现有的供电进行试验。由于没有实际的电网进行研究，吴教授不得不设计一个模拟实验室，其中包括理论风力发电机和太阳能电池板的输入，以输入一个持续运行的系统。为了实现真实的方法，研究人员在网格中构建了各种类型的设备故障来测试系统。和它的工作原理。
