### #272 Supply and Demand

```
The supply of a thing, in the phrase "supply and demand", is the amount that will be offered for sale at each of a series of prices; the demand is the amount that will be bought at each of a series of prices. The principle that value depends on supply and demand means that in the case of nearly every commodity, more will be bought if the price is lowered, less will be bought if the price is 
(答案：raised) . Therefore sellers, if they wish to induce buyers to 
(答案：take) more of a commodity than they are already doing, must reduce its price; if they raise its price, they will sell less. If there is a general falling off if in demand — due, say, to trade depression — sellers will either have to 
(答案：reduce) prices or put less on the 
(答案：market) ; they will not be able to sell the same 
(答案：amount) at the same price.

在短语“供给与需求”中，某物的供给是指以各种价格出售的数量;需求是在一系列价格下的购买量。价值取决于供需的原则意味着，对于几乎每一种商品来说，如果价格降低，人们会买得更多;如果价格提高，人们会买得更少。因此，如果卖方希望诱使买方购买比他们现在购买的更多的商品，就必须降低商品的价格;如果他们提高价格，他们的销售量就会减少。如果需求普遍下降——比如由于贸易萧条——卖方将不得不降低价格或减少在市场上的投放;他们将无法以同样的价格出售同样数量的商品。

\#271 Behavior Segments

One of the most 
(答案：eminent) of psychologists, Clark Hull, claimed that the essence of reasoning lies in the putting together of two 'behavior segments' in some

(答案：explicitly) based on Clark Hull's principles. The children were given the 
(答案：task) of learning to operate a machine so as to get a toy. In order to succeed they had to go through a two-stage sequence.

\#268 Flower Color

```
A flower's colour, however, isn't a full-proof guide to a good lunch. That's because the colour can change depending on the angle at which sunlight hits its petals. A yellow flower, for example, may look somewhat blue from one angle and red from another. Scientists call this kind of colour change iridescence. 'It's the same phenomenon that makes a rainbow appear in a soap bubble or on a CD, ' says Beverley Glover. She studies plants at the University of Cambridge in England. In 2009, Glover and her colleagues showed that even when petals look shimmery, bees can still tell which flowers likely hold food. But she and others noticed something odd about 
(答案：iridescence) . It's not quite as flashy in plants as in other life forms, Glover says. The backs of jewel, beetles, or the wings of certain butterflies, for instance, shine and shimmer a lot more. The researchers tested their hypothesis in the lab. They trained a group of bees to associate fake purple flowers with getting more nectar. Then the team 
(答案：tested) the bees. They added non-shimmery fake flowers with purple-blue and purple-red hues to the bees' flight path. The bees passed the test, ignoring flowers that weren't 
(答案：perfectly) purple. Second group of bees was 
(答案：trained) to drink from fully flashy, 'perfectly iridescent' purple flowers. But when the team added perfectly iridescent flowers in different hues, the insects checked them for nectar too.
