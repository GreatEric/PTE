### Edible Insects

First it was pets, then fish. Now it's poultry and pigs. The list of animals allowed to feed on insects is growing. A new EU law authorizing the use of insect protein in poultry and pig feed came into force earlier this month, a significant milestone for an industry keen to worm its way into the animal-feed business. Since a ban on processed animal protein was imposed in 2001 in the wake of the "mad cow" crisis, soy and fish meal have become the bedrock of animal feed in Europe.

首先是宠物，然后是鱼。现在是家禽和猪。允许以昆虫为食的动物名单正在增加。一项授权在家禽和猪饲料中使用昆虫蛋白的新欧盟法律于本月初生效，这对于一个热衷于进入动物饲料行业的行业来说是一个重要的里程碑。自 2001 年在“疯牛”危机之后对加工动物蛋白实施禁令以来，大豆和鱼粉已成为欧洲动物饲料的基石。

### Energy Price (能源价格)

It was another roller-coaster week for energy prices. After OPEC and its allies resisted calls to increase output, the price of Brent crude surpassed $80 per barrel and reached its highest level in three years. The cartel said it would stick to the gradual increases in output it agreed to over the summer. The energy shortage rattled other financial markets too, as investors worried about the fallout. In America and Europe government bond yields climbed. In Britain the yield on ten-year gilts jumped to its highest since May 2019.

这是能源价格又一个过山车的一周。在欧佩克及其盟友拒绝增加产量的呼吁后，布伦特原油价格超过每桶80美元，达到三年来的最高水平。该卡特尔表示，它将坚持在夏季同意的逐步增加产量。由于投资者担心后果，能源短缺也令其他金融市场感到不安。美国和欧洲的政府债券收益率攀升。在英国，10 年期英国国债收益率跃升至 2019 年 5 月以来的最高水平。

### Hormone

A hormone called relaxin helps loosen up pregnant women’s hips. Without it, the pain of delivery would be unbearable. Its job done, however, relaxing lingers in female bodies for up to a year, when softer ligaments make new mothers more prone to injury , as Jessica Ennis-Hill, an Olympic champion heptathlete, discovered in training after giving birth in 2014. Five years later Dame Jessica started Jennies, a fitness app to help other women perform safe post-natal workouts. It now lets users optimize workouts for the different phases of their menstrual cycles, and has just concluded a successful funding round.

一种叫做松弛素的激素有助于放松孕妇的臀部。没有它，分娩的痛苦将难以忍受。然而，它的工作完成后，女性身体的松弛时间长达一年，因为韧带较软使新妈妈更容易受伤，正如奥运会七项全能冠军杰西卡·恩尼斯-希尔在 2014 年分娩后在训练中发现的那样。 五年后来，Dame Jessica 创办了 Jennies，这是一款帮助其他女性进行安全产后锻炼的健身应用程序。现在，它可以让用户针对月经周期的不同阶段优化锻炼，并且刚刚成功完成了一轮融资。

### Minimum Tax

On the face of things, it seems both absurd and unfair that large American companies regularly whittle down their tax bills, taking advantage of every loophole on offer . One study found that at least 55 big companies incurred no federal taxes at all on their profits in 2020. A proposal being discussed as The Economist went to press, and as the Democratic Party scrambled to fund its social-spending package, seems to offer a popular solution: a minimum tax on corporate earnings as reported to shareholders, rather than as massaged down when reported to tax collectors.

从表面上看，美国大公司经常利用所提供的每一个漏洞来削减税收，这似乎既荒谬又不公平。一项研究发现，至少有 55 家大公司在 2020 年的利润中根本没有缴纳联邦税。在《经济学人》付印时以及民主党争相为其社会支出计划提供资金时，正在讨论的一项提案似乎提供了一个流行的解决方案：对向股东报告的公司收益征收最低税，而不是在向收税员报告时减少。

### Peaceful Power Transition

The Democratic Republic of the Congo will hold an election in December, hopefully leading to a peaceful democratic transfer of power for the first time in the country's history. Sitting President Joseph Kabila came to power in 2001, having succeeded his father, Laurent Désiré Kabila, after his assassination. Joseph Kabila was elected as President in 2006 for a five-year term, and re-elected in 2011. Though his second term ended in 2016 and the DRC constitution prevents him from seeking a third term, elections were not held and Kabila remained in power.

刚果民主共和国将于12月举行选举，希望能实现该国历史上第一次和平民主的权力移交。现任总统约瑟夫·卡比拉(Joseph Kabila)在他的父亲劳伦特·Désiré卡比拉(Laurent Désiré Kabila)被暗杀后，于2001年接任总统。约瑟夫·卡比拉(Joseph Kabila) 2006年当选总统，任期5年，2011年再次当选。尽管他的第二个任期于2016年结束，刚果民主共和国宪法禁止他寻求第三个任期，但选举没有举行，卡比拉继续掌权。

### Climate Change

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released the first part of its latest assessment report. The Earth is warming. Even with a drastic reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions temperatures will probably be 1.5 degrees Celsius above their late-19th century levels by 2050. Climate change is under way, the report laments, with all the environmental consequences that brings. The extent of the damage depends on the cumulative build-up of emissions and can be limited if the world strives for net-zero carbon emissions.

政府间气候变化专门委员会发布了其最新评估报告的第一部分。地球正在变暖。即使温室气体排放大幅减少，到2050年气温仍可能比19世纪末的水平高出1.5摄氏度。报告哀叹道，气候变化正在发生，随之而来的是各种环境后果。破坏的程度取决于排放的累积，如果全世界努力实现净零碳排放，破坏的程度是有限的。

lament: 哀叹

net-zero 净零

strive 奋斗；努力；力求；斗争

### Robot Software

It might sound obvious that if you want to improve a robot's software, you should improve its software. Agrim Gupta of Stanford University, however, begs to differ. He thinks you can also improve a robot's software by improving its hardware—that is, by letting the hardware adapt itself to the software's capabilities. As they describe in Nature Communications, he and his colleagues have devised a way of testing this idea. In doing so, they have brought to robotics the principles of evolution by natural selection. They also cast the spotlight on an evolutionary idea that dates from the 1890s, but which has hitherto proved hard to demonstrate.

如果你想改进机器人的软件，你就应该改进它的软件，这听起来很明显。然而，斯坦福大学的Agrim Gupta却不这么认为。他认为，你也可以通过改进硬件来改进机器人的软件，也就是说，让硬件适应软件的功能。正如他们在《自然通讯》杂志上所描述的那样，他和他的同事们设计了一种测试这种想法的方法。在此过程中，他们给机器人带来了自然选择的进化原理。他们还把焦点放在了一个可以追溯到19世纪90年代的进化思想上，但迄今为止它被证明是难以证明的。

```

### European Market

European market is a tough terrain for food delivery firms. Delivery Hero has had a good run in the past couple of years. In August 2020 it ascended to the Dax, the stock market index of Germany's most valuable listed firms. It is present in 50 countries on four continents. Revenue for the third quarter was 1.8bn euros ($2bn), a jump of 89% compared with the same period in 2020. “We grew 100% before Corona, 100% during Corona and we will grow 100% after Corona,” says Niklas Ostberg, the Berlin-based firm's Swedish chief executive. By number of orders Delivery Hero is more than twice as big as DoorDash, its large American rival.

欧洲市场对食品外卖公司来说是一个艰难的市场。在过去的几年里，“快递英雄”运营得很好。2020年8月，它登上了德国Dax指数，这是德国最有价值的上市公司的股票市场指数。它在四大洲的50个国家中存在。第三季度收入为18亿欧元(20亿美元)，与2020年同期相比增长89%。这家总部位于柏林的公司的瑞典籍首席执行官尼克拉斯·奥斯特伯格表示:“我们在冠状病毒之前增长了100%，在冠状病毒期间增长了100%，在冠状病毒之后也将增长100%。”从订单数量来看，Delivery Hero的订单量是其美国竞争对手DoorDash的两倍多。

### Lyrics

The lives of distinguished people often take a lot of telling. Yet even devotees might raise an eyebrow at the heft of Sir Paul McCartney’s memoir: two volumes totaling 960 pages. Casual Beatles fans may be surprised by the title, too. Though most would consider Sir Paul the band’s best musician (with an honorable mention for George Harrison), John Lennon typically gets the plaudits for writing. In a poll by the BBC in 2001 to rank the greatest lyricists, Lennon received more than twice as many votes as McCartney.

名人的生活往往需要大量的讲述。然而，即使是忠实的读者也可能会对保罗·麦卡特尼爵士的回忆录的分量感到惊讶:两卷共960页。披头士的普通粉丝可能也会对这个名字感到惊讶。尽管大多数人认为保罗爵士是乐队最好的音乐家(乔治·哈里森获得了荣誉奖)，但约翰·列侬通常因写作而获得喝彩。2001年，英国广播公司(BBC)进行了一项评选最伟大词人的投票，列侬获得的票数是麦卡特尼的两倍多。

### Food Rules

Like every farmer Courtney Hammond, who grows blueberries and cranberries in Washington County, Maine, has a lot of worries. He frets about weather, invasive species, failed crops and global prices. To abide by federal food-safety laws, he has had to do training, maintain meticulous records, have insect- and rodent-control plans and document daily the sanitation of his processing equipment. It is a tremendous amount of work but it means, he says, "I don't have to worry about anybody getting sick from eating anything that leaves my farm." Now he is worried that a new law may put his hard work in jeopardy. Earlier this month 61% of voters opted to change the state constitution to ensure that all Mainers had a "right to food", the first law of its kind in America.

像每个在缅因州华盛顿县种植蓝莓和蔓越莓的农民一样，考特尼·哈蒙德(Courtney Hammond)有很多担忧。他为天气、入侵物种、歉收和全球价格而烦恼。为了遵守联邦食品安全法，他必须进行培训，保持详细的记录，制定昆虫和啮齿动物控制计划，每天记录加工设备的卫生情况。这是一项巨大的工作，但这意味着，他说，“我不必担心任何人因为吃了我农场里的任何东西而生病。”现在，他担心一项新法律可能会使他的辛勤工作陷入困境。本月早些时候，61%的选民选择修改州宪法，以确保所有缅因人都有“食物权”，这是美国第一部此类法律。

### Political Violence

On August 4, explosives aboard two drones flying near Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro as he spoke in Caracas were detonated. Seven people were injured. Maduro has used the incident as a pretext to crack down on Venezuela's opposition by unleashing the regime's secret police. State Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert said, “The United States condemns the political violence that occurred on August 4 and urges the Maduro regime to respect the rule of law, exercise restraint, and safeguard the presumption of innocence for all accused.”

8月4日，当委内瑞拉总统Nicolás Maduro在加拉加斯发表讲话时，两架无人机携带的炸药被引爆。7人受伤。马杜罗以这一事件为借口，通过释放政府的秘密警察来镇压委内瑞拉反对派。美国国务院发言人诺尔特(Heather Nauert)表示，“美国谴责8月4日发生的政治暴力事件，敦促马杜罗政权尊重法治，保持克制，维护所有被告的无罪推定。”

### Women's Occupations

Even if the distribution of women's occupations matched that of men—"if women were the doctors and men were the nurses"—she calculates that at most a third of the pay gap would disappear. The most important cause is that women curtail their careers as a part of a rational household response to labour markets, which generously reward anyone, male or female, who is willing to hold down what Ms Goldin calls a "greedy job". These are roles, such as those in law, accountancy and finance, that demand long and unpredictable hours. Parents need somebody to be on-call at home in case a child falls ill and needs picking up from school, or needs cheering on at a concert or football match.

即使女性的职业分布与男性相同——“如果女性是医生，男性是护士”——她计算出，最多三分之一的收入差距将消失。最重要的原因是，作为家庭对劳动力市场理性反应的一部分，女性缩减了自己的职业生涯。劳动力市场慷慨地奖励任何愿意保住Goldin女士所说的“贪婪的工作”的人，无论男女。这些职位，比如法律、会计和金融行业，需要长时间且难以预测的工作时间。父母需要有人在家待命，以防孩子生病需要从学校接走，或者在音乐会或足球比赛中需要加油助威。

### Business

High staff churn is here to stay. Retention strategies require a rethink. In the not-so-distant past, bosses did not have to worry as much about their workforces. Newcomers could absorb the corporate culture osmotically. Workers’ families were invisible, not constantly interrupting Zoom calls. Employees had a job, not a voice. Now firms have to “be intentional” (management-speak for thinking) about everything from the point of the office to how staff communicate with each other. Retention is the latest area to require attention. The spike in staff departures known as the Great Resignation is centered on America: a record 3% of the workforce there quit their jobs in September.

高员工流动率将持续下去。留存策略需要重新思考。在不远的过去，老板们不必如此担心他们的员工。新人可以潜移默化地吸收企业文化。员工的家人是隐形的，不会经常打断Zoom的电话。员工有工作，没有发言权。现在公司必须“有意识”(管理术语，意思是思考)考虑从办公室到员工之间如何沟通的所有事情。留存率是需要关注的最新领域。被称为“大辞职”的员工离职高峰主要发生在美国:9月份，美国有创纪录的3%的员工辞职。

### Man from Future

In 1945, while in a state of exhaustion , the mathematician John von Neumann had a kind of stammering premonition. He was in Los Alamos, working on the atom bomb, and he told his wife Klari that the “energy source” he was helping to develop would make scientists “the most hated and also the most wanted citizens of any country”. Then he informed her that his other ongoing project, the computer, would one day be even more important—and potentially even more dangerous. Good biographies of some of the greatest mathematical minds are rare: because they were polymaths, biographers who can interpret their manifold achievements for the ordinary mortal are themselves thin on the ground. This has been von Neumann’s fate, and the upshot is that he has not had the recognition he deserves.

1945年，数学家约翰·冯·诺伊曼(John von Neumann)在精疲力竭的状态下，有一种口吃的预感。他当时在洛斯阿拉莫斯(Los Alamos)研究原子弹，他告诉妻子卡拉里(Klari)，他正在帮助开发的“能源”将使科学家“成为任何国家最讨厌的，也是最受欢迎的公民”。然后他告诉她，他正在进行的另一个项目，计算机，有一天会变得更重要——而且可能会更危险。一些最伟大的数学天才的优秀传记是罕见的:因为他们是博学多才，能够为普通人解释他们的诸多成就的传记作家本身就不多了。这就是冯·诺伊曼的命运，结果是他没有得到应有的认可。

### Congressional Bill

President Trump has reluctantly signed into law a congressional bill imposing sanctions on Russia over its policy in Ukraine and alleged meddling in last year's US presidential election. Afterwards, he called the legislation seriously flawed, saying it encroachedon his powers to negotiate foreign policy and hurt the interests of European allies. The company that provided the Venezuelan voting system for the controversial constituent assembly elections says the turnout figure was inflated by at least one million. The speaker of the opposition-controlled National Assembly called on prosecutors to open a criminal investigation immediately.

特朗普总统不情愿地签署了一项对俄罗斯实施制裁的国会法案，原因是俄罗斯对乌克兰的政策，以及俄罗斯涉嫌干预去年的美国总统选举。随后，他称该法案存在严重缺陷，称其侵犯了他在外交政策上的谈判权力，并损害了欧洲盟友的利益。为委内瑞拉有争议的制宪会议选举提供投票系统的公司表示，投票率至少被夸大了100万。反对派控制的国民议会议长呼吁检察官立即展开刑事调查。

### Climate Agreement

The United States has confirmed that it will pull out of the Paris climate agreement. Washington has informed the United Nations, formally implementing a decision by President Trump in June. But the State Department said the U.S. would continue to participate in climate change meetings until the withdrawal process was completed. New research indicates that weather-related disasters could kill more than 150,000 people in Europe each year by the end of the century. The European Commission report estimated that heat waves would cause 99% of all weather-related deaths on the continent.

美国已经证实将退出巴黎气候协议。华盛顿已通知联合国，正式执行特朗普总统6月作出的一项决定。但美国国务院表示，在退出进程完成之前，美国将继续参加气候变化会议。新的研究表明，到本世纪末，与天气有关的灾害每年可能导致欧洲超过15万人死亡。欧盟委员会的报告估计，热浪将导致欧洲大陆99%的与天气有关的死亡。

### Terrorist Attack

The Venezuelan authorities say they have suppressed, what they termed, a terrorist attack on an army base in the City of Valencia. Diosdado Cabello of the governing United Socialist Party, said loyal troops re-established security at the base. Officials said 7 people have been arrested and at least one of them died. Afghan officials say at least 50 people, including women and children, have been killed by militants in the northern province of Sari Pul. A spokesman told BBC that insurgents attacked security checkpoints and entered a village, killing civilians, among them women and children. He said Taliban and Islamic State fighters were involved, but Taliban has denied killings civilians. They say they killed 28 members of a local militia.

委内瑞拉当局表示，他们镇压了巴伦西亚市一处军事基地的恐怖袭击。执政的统一社会党的Diosdado Cabello说，忠诚的军队重建了基地的安全。官方称已有7人被捕，至少一人死亡。阿富汗官员说，包括妇女和儿童在内的至少50人在北部的沙里普尔省被激进分子杀害。一名发言人告诉BBC，叛乱分子袭击了安全检查站，并进入一个村庄，杀害平民，其中包括妇女和儿童。他说，塔利班和伊斯兰国武装分子参与其中，但塔利班否认杀害平民。他们说，他们杀死了28名当地民兵。

### U.S. Investment

Executive Vice President of the U.S. government's Overseas Private Investment Corporation, OPIC, David Bohigian and other U.S. government officials traveled to Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia in August to promote U.S. investment in those countries. OPIC is the U.S. Government's development finance institution. It mobilizes private capital to help address critical development challenges and in doing so, advances U.S. foreign policy and national security priorities. On August 14th, the U.S. delegation met with Armenian Minister of Economic Development and Investments Artsvik Minasyan.

美国政府海外私人投资公司(OPIC)执行副总裁大卫·波希吉安(David Bohigian)和其他美国政府官员8月访问了亚美尼亚、阿塞拜疆和格鲁吉亚，促进美国在这些国家的投资。OPIC是美国政府的发展金融机构。它动员私人资本帮助应对重大的发展挑战，并通过这样做推进美国的外交政策和国家安全优先事项。8月14日，美国代表团会见了亚美尼亚经济发展和投资部部长Artsvik Minasyan。

### Election Commission

Within the past few minutes, the election commission in Kenya has declared that Tuesday’s presidential election was won by the incumbent Uhuru Kenyatta. The opposition which has complained fraud has rejected the results. An opposition spokesman described the process as a masquerade. World leaders have expressed concern of the war of words between Washington and Pyongyang over North Korea’s nuclear program. After President Trump said the US military was locked and loaded, North Korea accused him of driving the situation to the brink of nuclear war. Russia, China and Germany have all appealed the calm and further diplomatic efforts.
